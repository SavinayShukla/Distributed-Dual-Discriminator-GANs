# Distributed Training of Dual Discriminator GANs.
### Authors : Savinay Shukla, Ishaan Pitty

In this project, we propose add another discriminator in a typical DCGAN training pipeline for the Generator to acheive better and faster convergence. Adding another discriminator will force the Generator to fool two discriminators at once, and disallow any the dominance of Discriminator training.
